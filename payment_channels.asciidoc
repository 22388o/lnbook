== Payment Channels

In this chapter we will dive into payment channels and see how they are constructed. We will start with Alice's node opening a channel to Bob's node, building on the examples presented in the beginning of this book.

The messages exchanged by Alice and Bob's nodes are defined in https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/02-peer-protocol.md["BOLT2 - Peer Protocol"]. The transactions created by Alice and Bob's nodes are defined in https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/03-transactions.md["BOLT3 - Transactions"]. In this chapter we are focusing on the "Channel Open & Close" and "Channel State Machine" parts of the Lightning protocol architecture, highlighted by a double outline in the center (Peer 2 Peer Layer) of <<LN_protocol_channel_highlight>>:

=== A different way of using the Bitcoin system

The Lightning Network is often described as a "Layer 2 Bitcoin Protocol", which makes it sound distinct from Bitcoin. Another way to describe Lightning is as a "different way to use Bitcoin". Let's explore that.

Normally, Bitcoin transactions are broadcast to everyone and recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain in order to be considered "valid". As we will see however, if someone holds a pre-signed Bitcoin transaction that gives them the exclusive ability to spend that Bitcoin, they effectively own that Bitcoin even if they don't broadcast the transaction.

Effectively, the pre-signed Bitcoin transaction is like a post-dated cheque, that can be "cashed" at anytime. Unlike the traditional banking system however, this transaction is not a "promise" of payment (also known as an IOU), but a verifiable bearer instrument that is equivalent to cash. The Bitcoin system guarantees that this pre-signed transaction can be broadcast and recorded at any time.

The Lightning Network is simpy a different and creative way of using Bitcoin. In the Lightning Network a combination of recorded (on-chain) and pre-signed but withheld (off-chain) transactions form a "layer" of payments that is a faster, cheaper and more private way to use Bitcoin. You can see this relationship between on-chain and off-chain Bitcoin transactions in <<on_off_chain>>:

Lightning is Bitcoin. It's just a different way of using the Bitcoin system.

=== Bitcoin ownership and control

Before we understand payment channels, we have to take a small step back and understand how ownership and control work in Bitcoin.

When someone says they "own" bitcoin they typically mean that they know the private key of a Bitcoin address that has some unspent transaction outputs (see <<bitcoin_fundamentals_review>>). The private key allows them to sign a transaction to spend that bitcoin by transferring it to a different address. In Bitcoin "ownership" of bitcoin can be defined as the _ability to spend_ that bitcoin.

Keep in mind that the term "ownership" as used in Bitcoin is distinct from the term "ownership" used in a legal sense. A thief who has the private keys and can spend Bitcoin is a de-facto "owner" of that Bitcoin even though they are not a lawful owner.

[TIP]
====
Bitcoin ownership is only about control of keys and the ability to spend the bitoin with those keys. As the popular Bitcoin saying by Andreas Antonopoulos goes: "Your keys, your coins - not your keys, not your coins"
====

==== Diversity of ownership and multisig

Ownership and control of private keys is not always in the hands of one person. That's where things get interesting and complicated.

Firstly, more than one person can come to know the same private key, either through theft or because the original holder of the key makes a copy and gives it to someone else. Are all these people owners? In a practical sense they are, because any one of the people who know the private key can spend the bitcoin without the approval of any other.

Secondly, Bitcoin has multisignature addresses where multiple private keys are needed to sign before spending (see <<multisig>>). From a practical perspective, ownership depends on the quorum (K) and total (N) defined in the K-of-N scheme. If one or more people has enough keys to make quorum, then they *all* equally own the bitcoin. For example, a 1-of-10 multisignature scheme would allow any one (K) of 10 (N) signers to spend a bitcoin amount locked in that address. This is similar to the scenario where ten people have a copy of the same private key and any of them can independently spend it.

==== Joint ownership without independent control

There is also the scenario where *no one* has quorum. In a 2-of-2 scheme like that used in the Lightning Network, each of the signers cannot spend the bitcoin without obtaining a signature from the other party. Who owns the bitcoin in that case? No one really has ownership because no one has control. They each own the equivalent of a voting share in the decision, but both votes are needed. A key problem with a 2-of-2 scheme (in both Bitcoin and the law) is what happens if one of the parties is unavailable, or if there is a vote deadlock and any one party refuses to cooperate.

==== Preventing "locked" and unspendable Bitcoin

If one of the two signers of a 2-of-2 multisig cannot or will not sign, the funds become unspendable. Not only can this scenario occur accientally (loss of keys), but it can be used as a form of blackmail by either party: "I won't sign unless you pay me a part of the funds".

Payment channels in Lightning are based on a 2-of-2 multisig address, with the two channel partners as signers in the multisig. At this time, channels are funded only by one of the two channel partners: When you choose to "open" a channel you deposit funds into the 2-of-2 multisig address with a transaction. Once that transaction is mined and the funds are in the multisig, you can't get them back without cooperation from your channel partner, because you need their signature (also) to spend the 2-of-2.

In the next section, as we look at how to open (create) a Lightning channel, we will see how we can prevent loss of funds or any blackmail scenario between the two partners by implementing a fairness protocol for the channel construction.


=== Constructing a payment channel

In <<what_is_payment_channel>, we described payment channels as a _financial relatonship_ between two Lightning Nodes, which is established by funding a 2-of-2 multisignature address from the two channel partners.

Let's assume that Alice's wallet wants to construct a payment channel to connect to Bob's store directly. First, the two nodes (Alice's and Bob's) have to establish an internet connection to each other, so that they can negotiate a payment channel.

==== Cryptographic protocol vs. message protocol

We will be using the term "protocol" to describe two different protocols in this scenario. First, there is a _message protocol_, which establishes how the Lightning Nodes communicate over the internet and what messages they exchange with each other. Second, there is the _cryptographic protocol_ which establishes how the two nodes negotiate and secure a payment channel and other smart contracts build with Bitcoin Script.

==== Node private and public keys

Every node on the Lightning Network is identified by a _node public key_. The public key uniquely identifies the specific node and is usually presented as a hexadecimal encoding. For example, Rene Pickhardt currently runs a Lightning Node (+ln.rene-pickhardt.de+) that is identified by the following node public key:

----
03efccf2c383d7bf340da9a3f02e2c23104a0e4fe8ac1a880c8e2dc92fbdacd9df
----

Each node generates a root private key when first initialized. The private key is kept private at all times (never shared) and securely stored in the node's wallet. From that private key, the node derives a public key which is the node identifier and shared with the network. Since the key space is enormous, as long as each node generates the private key randomly, it will have a unique public key, which can therefore uniquely identify it on the network.

==== Node network address

Additionally, every node also advertizes a network address where it can be reached, in one of several possible formats:

TCP/IP:: An IPv4 or IPv6 address and TCP port number

TCP/Tor:: A Tor "onion" address and TCP port number

The network address identifier is written as +Address:Port+, which is consistent with international standards for network identifiers, as used for example on the web.

For example, Rene's node with node public key +03efcc...acd9df+ currently advertizes it's network address as the TCP/IP address:

----
144.76.235.20:9735
----

[TIP]
====
The default TCP port for the Lightning Network is 9735, but a node can choose to listen on any TCP port.
====

==== Node identifiers

Together the node public key and network address are written in the following format, separated by an +@+ sign, as +NodeID@Address:Port+

So the full identifier for Rene's node would be:

----
03efccf2c383d7bf340da9a3f02e2c23104a0e4fe8ac1a880c8e2dc92fbdacd9df@144.76.235.20:9735
----

The identifier above is often encoded in a QR code, making it easier for users to scan, if they want to connect their own node to the specific node identified by that address.

Much like Bitcoin Nodes, Lightning Nodes advertize their presence on the Lightning Network by "gossiping" their node public key and network address. That way, other nodes can find them and keep an inventory (database) of all the known nodes that they can connect to and exchange the messages that are defined in the Lightning P2P message protocol.

==== Connecting nodes as direct peers

In order for Alice's node to connect to Bob's node, she will need Bob's node public key, or the full address containing the public key, IP or Tor address and port. Because Bob runs a store, Bob's node address can be retrieved from an invoice or a store payment page on the web. Alice can scan a QR code that contains the address and instruct her node to connect to Bob's node.

Once Alice has connected to Bob's node, their nodes are now directly connected _peers_.

[TIP]
====
To open a payment channel, two nodes must first be _connected_ as direct peers by opening a connection over the internet (or Tor).

==== Generating a multisignature address



=== Funding the channel

==== The funding transaction

==== Holding signed transactions without broadcasting


=== Refund before funding

To prevent loss of funds, we cannot put our bitcoin into a 2-of-2 until we have a way to get a refund if things go wrong. Essentially, we plan the "exit" from the channel before we enter into this arrangement.

Consider the legal construct of a prenuptual agreement, also known as a "prenup". When two people enter into a marriage their money is bound together by law (depending on jursidiction). Prior to entering into the marriage, they can sign an agreement that specifies how to separate their money if they dissolve their marriage through divorce.

In Bitcoin, we can solve a deadlock in a 2-of-2 by having a transaction signed by both signers to spend any funds, before putting those funds into the address.
