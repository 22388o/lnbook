== Operating a Lightning Network Node

=== Choosing your platform

* Installers/distributions (raspiblitz, mynode)
* Full node backend (bitcoind, btcd) or lightweight backend (neutrino)
* What hardware will you use
  * Minimum Hardware requirements
  * CPU
  * RAM
  * Storage (HDD, SSD)
  * Bandwidth
* Where will you host it (cloud hosting, VPS, own server, your laptop, RPi, MiniPC)
* What OS will you use (Linux variant, Windows, other)
* Docker or direct installation

=== Choose your node implementation

* Which project (LND, eclair, c-lightning, other) will you use
* Language and build-system familiarity
* Integration needs
* Features
* Performance

=== Node startup and configuration

* Startup and headless operation
* Process isolation
* Auto-unlocking
* IBD configuration
* Fine tuning performance
* RPC security and authentication
* Logging
* Process monitoring

=== Node and channel backups

* Difference between Bitcoin wallet (BIP39) backups and LN backups
* Need for backup of channel state

==== Static channel backups

=== Security of your machine

==== Hot wallet risk

==== Sweeping funds

===== On-chain sweep
===== Off-chain sweep

==== Watchtowers

=== Channel management

==== Private vs public channels

==== Manually choosing nodes for outbound channels

==== Autopilot

==== Getting inbound liquidity

==== Submarine swaps

==== Splice-in/Splice-out


=== Routing fees

* Earning fees from routing
* Setting routing fees
  * High volume/low cost vs. High cost/low volume
  * Zero fee routing

=== Node monitoring

* RTL
* lndash
* External node monitors (1ml etc.)

=== Channel maintenance

==== Inactive channels and nodes
==== When to force-close
==== Re-balancing channels

=== Running multiple Lightning Network nodes

==== Private channels
==== Topology

* Ring topology
* Mesh topology
* Public nodes vs "hidden" private nodes
